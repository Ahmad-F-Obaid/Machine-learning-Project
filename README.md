# Machine-learning-Project

## Introduction
<br>Fraud detection in financial transactions is a critical area of study that directly impacts the integrity and security of modern banking and payment systems. Fraudulent activities, such as unauthorized transfers or cash withdrawals, can result in significant financial losses for institutions and individuals alike. According to industry reports, financial fraud costs businesses billions of dollars annually, making it imperative to develop robust systems capable of identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time.
The challenge lies in the fact that fraudulent transactions are exceedingly rare, often making up less than 1% of total transactions in a dataset. This inherent class imbalance complicates the training process for machine learning models, which tend to favor the majority class unless special techniques are applied. Additionally, fraudulent behavior is highly dynamic, requiring models to adapt to evolving patterns and techniques used by fraudsters.
This project focuses on building an automated fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of financial transactions, the goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent while addressing challenges such as class imbalance, feature engineering, and performance evaluation. Multiple machine learning models are explored, including LightGBM, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and their performances are compared based on metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
